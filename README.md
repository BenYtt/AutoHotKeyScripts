# AutoHotkeyScripts

To run any of theese scripts [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) needs to be correctly installed. 

## AutoCastD3

This script aims to help players used to "numlock-casting" in Diablo 3 to achieve the same thing using this simple script.

*Run the script.*

* **F1-F4** to auto cast spells bound to **NUM1-NUM4**, press the same key again to it turn off.
* Press **HOME** to exit the script, otherwise if will run until your computer is shut down.

*NOTE: I'm unaware if this breaks Blizzards [ToS](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/legal/fba4d00f-c7e4-4883-b8b9-1b4500a402ea/blizzard-end-user-license-agreement), so use this at your own risk.*

## PlayerCount Diablo2

This script is for the lazy or fat fingered Diablo 2 player looking for a faster and easier way to change /players when playing the game. 

*Run the script.*

* Press **F1** to set **/players 8**
* Press **F2** to set **/players 7**
* Press **F3** to set **/players 5**
* Press **F4** to set **/players 3**
* Press **F5** to set **/players 1**
* Press **HOME** to **exit**, otherwise if will run until your computer is shut down.
* Pressing **F1** (setting **/players 8**) and then pressing **F2** will set **/players 7**, it's the same for all key combinations.

*NOTE: I'm unaware if this breaks Blizzards [ToS](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/legal/fba4d00f-c7e4-4883-b8b9-1b4500a402ea/blizzard-end-user-license-agreement), so use this at your own risk.*

## QuickExitD2

This is an instant one button quit macro I made for running HC to avoid deaths. The keybinds **F1-F6** and **ยง** will only work when the process D2R.exe is running. I highly recommend making sure the script is running (F7) so that you don't die.

*Run the script.*

* Press **F1** to enter the game on the selected character on hell difficulty.
* Press **ยง** to **quit** the current game.
* Press **F2** to set **/players 1**
* Press **F3** to set **/players 3**
* Press **F4** to set **/players 5**
* Press **F5** to set **/players 7**
* Press **F6** to set **/players 8**
* Press **F7** to display a message box if the script is running.
* Press **HOME** to **exit** the script. A message box with a confirmation will be shown on the screen.
